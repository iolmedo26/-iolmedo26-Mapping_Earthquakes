Mapping_Earthquakes
The main objective of this project was to create an interactive map to show the records of earthquakes with a magnitude of 4.5+ during the last 7 days. The objective of this project is to gather earthquake GeoJSON data from the USGS API, create and explore interactive maps of earthquakes around the world.
The earthquake data is represented on the maps in relation to the tectonic platesâ€™ location on the earth, and according to each event's magnitude.

Our map includes layers, which show different information when filtered. These layers are: Earthquakes, Plate Tectonics, and Major Earthquakes.

To better identify the weakest and strongest earthquakes on our map, we created a magnitude scale from 0 to 5+ and transformed our data into circleMarkers with color and radius.

Three types of tile layers were created to display the map view, such as streets, satellite, and darkness.

Finally, we added a popup to display the magnitude and location of the earthquake.
